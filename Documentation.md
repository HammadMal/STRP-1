```python
self.setMinimumSize(700, 500)  # Minimum width, height (increased for enhanced UI)
self.resize(800, 600)          # Default width, height (increased for batch features)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No module named 'PyQt6'"**: 
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6
   ```

2. **"No module named 'pandas'"**: 
   ```bash
   pip install pandas openpyxl
   ```

3. **"Module 'clo_plo_calculator' not found"**:
   - Ensure all Python files are in the same directory
   - Check that `clo_plo_calculator.py` exists

4. **"Module 'excel_exporter' not found"**:
   - Ensure `excel_exporter.py` is in the same directory
   - Check file permissions

5. **Encoding errors with special characters**:
   - The data.py script now forces UTF-8 encoding
   - Special characters are replaced with ASCII equivalents

6. **"Processing script 'data.py' not found"**:
   - Ensure data.py is in the same directory as interface.py

7. **Excel files not loading**: 
   - Install openpyxl: `pip install openpyxl`
   - Ensure the Excel file has a sheet named 'Data'

8. **Process button stays disabled**: 
   - Check that file(s) loaded successfully
   - Check status messages for errors

9. **Excel export fails but calculations succeed**:
   - Check file permissions in the current directory
   - Ensure no other process has the output file(s) open
   - Full calculation results are still available in terminal

### CLO Detection Specific Issues

10. **"No CLOs found in course structure"**:
    - Check that your Excel file has CLO definitions in the correct format
    - Ensure CLO descriptions are meaningful (longer than 10 characters)
    - Verify that cells start with "CLO" followed by a number

11. **"Wrong number of CLOs in Excel output"**:
    - Check the debug output to see which CLOs were detected
    - Verify that all CLO definitions have proper descriptions
    - CLO 0 is automatically excluded from Excel output (bonus points)

12. **"CLO descriptions appear wrong"**:
    - Ensure CLO definitions are in separate rows from PLO mappings
    - Check that there are no empty rows between CLO definitions
    - Verify the Excel file structure matches expected format

### Batch Processing Specific Issues

13. **"No Excel files found in the selected folder"**:
    - Ensure the folder contains .xlsx or .xls files
    - Check that files are not corrupted or password-protected

14. **Some files in batch fail to process**:
    - This is normal - check the Batch Progress tab for specific errors
    - Failed files are reported separately and don't stop the batch
    - Different files may have different CLO structures (this is supported)

15. **Batch processing takes a long time**:
    - This is expected for large numbers of files
    - Monitor progress in the Batch Progress tab
    - Individual file progress is shown in real-time

16. **Memory issues with large batches**:
    - Consider processing smaller batches (50-100 files at a time)
    - Close other applications to free up memory
    - Large files (>50MB each) may require additional system resources

## Enhanced Data Flow

### Single File Mode (Enhanced)
1. **File Selection**: User selects Excel file through file dialog
2. **File Validation**: Background validation of file format and content
3. **CLO Structure Analysis**: Dynamic identification of all defined CLOs in the course
4. **Data Processing**: data.py extracts and cleans raw data with flexible CLO detection
5. **JSON Parsing**: Structured data extracted from data.py output
6. **Score Calculation**: CLO, PLO, and grade calculations performed for detected CLOs
7. **Terminal Display**: Results printed to console with emojis, formatting, and debug info
8. **Excel Generation**: Formatted report appended to original file with only relevant CLOs
9. **User Notification**: Success dialog with file path information

### Batch Mode (Enhanced)
1. **Folder Selection**: User selects folder containing multiple Excel files
2. **File Discovery**: Background scanning for all Excel files in folder
3. **Batch Validation**: Each file validated individually
4. **Individual CLO Analysis**: Each file's CLO structure analyzed independently
5. **Batch Processing**: Sequential processing of all valid files
6. **Individual Processing**: Each file goes through the complete single-file workflow
7. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates for overall progress and current file
8. **Result Aggregation**: Success/failure tracking for each file with CLO-specific details
9. **Batch Summary**: Comprehensive summary dialog and terminal output

## Performance Considerations

### Single File Processing
- **Typical Processing Time**: 2-10 seconds per file (depending on size and complexity)
- **CLO Detection Overhead**: Minimal additional time for dynamic CLO analysis
- **Memory Usage**: Low - single file processed at a time
- **UI Responsiveness**: Non-blocking background processing

### Batch Processing
- **Processing Time**: Scales linearly with number of files (2-10 seconds √ó number of files)
- **CLO Structure Independence**: Each file analyzed independently for optimal accuracy
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate - processes files sequentially to manage memory
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress updates prevent perceived freezing
- **Error Isolation**: Individual file failures don't impact overall batch

### Optimization Tips
- **File Organization**: Group similar files in folders for efficient batch processing
- **System Resources**: Close unnecessary applications when processing large batches
- **File Size**: Extremely large files (>100MB) may require additional processing time
- **Network Drives**: Local file processing is faster than network drives
- **CLO Consistency**: Files with similar CLO structures process slightly faster
